Today I received an award from the [Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)](https://www.theiet.org/) at a fantastic ceremony at Saville Place in London. The IET awards recognise postgraduate research students from around the world conducting research in engineering-related topics. You can read about the 2019 winners [here](https://www.theiet.org/impact-society/awards-scholarships/iet-postgraduate-research-awards/2019-winners/).

I was awarded the [Leslie H. Paddle scholarship](https://www.theiet.org/impact-society/awards-scholarships/iet-postgraduate-research-awards/) which was established in 1979 under a bequest from Leslie H. Paddle, the vice-president of the Institution of Electronic and Radio Engineers (IERE).

Many thanks to the IET for an excellent evening at Saville Place. It was great to see the global outlook and breadth of the [IET awards and scholarships programme](https://www.theiet.org/impact-society/awards-scholarships/).
