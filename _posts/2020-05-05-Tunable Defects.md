My latest paper "Electrically-tunable positioning of topological defects in liquid crystals" has been [published in Nature Communications today](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16059-1)! 

I have written a "Behind The Paper" post explaining topological defects in liquid crystals to a general audience, which you can find [here](https://chemistrycommunity.nature.com/channels/1465-behind-the-paper/posts/66317-bringing-order-to-disorder-topological-defects-in-liquid-crystals). 

The Department of Engineering Science at Oxford have written a [featured news item on the paper](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/news/bringing-order-to-disorder-in-liquid-crystals/).
