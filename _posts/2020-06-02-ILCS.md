The International Liquid Crystal Society (ILCS) have chosen my image entitled '[Trapped Transitions](https://www.ilcsoc.org/art-contest/featured-art/)' as their Liquid Crystal Picture of the Month! It will be featured on the [ILCS homepage](https://www.ilcsoc.org/) throughout June. 

You can see other beautiful liquid crystal related images in the [ILCS Gallery](https://www.ilcsoc.org/art-contest/gallery/).

"A polymer channel laser-written in a pi-cell liquid crystal device, inspired by developments in microfluidics technology. The device is relaxing to a topologically discontinuous director state and the transition is confined and unable to penetrate through the topologically discontinuous polymer walls. Scale: the central channel is 45 Âµm in width."
