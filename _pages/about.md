I'm John Sandford O'Neill, a PhD student at the University of Oxford working on 3D laser printing in soft materials. My research brings together laser micro-machining and the science & technology of liquid crystals & polymers. I use a titanium-sapphire femtosecond laser to create microscale polymer structures directly inside electrically-controlled liquid crystal devices. This is of scientific interest as it opens-up a new parameter for creating microstructures with a locally-varying refractive index. This research is also of interest from a commercial/industrial perspective as it can be used to design better liquid crystal displays and optical devices. My research is currently funded by the [EPSRC](https://epsrc.ukri.org/) with industrial sponsorship from [Merck](https://www.merckgroup.com/).

My latest paper "Electrically-tunable positioning of topological defects in liquid crystals" has been [published in Nature Communications today](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16059-1)! 

I have written a "Behind The Paper" post explaining topological defects in liquid crystals, which you can find [here](https://chemistrycommunity.nature.com/channels/1465-behind-the-paper/posts/66317-bringing-order-to-disorder-topological-defects-in-liquid-crystals).
